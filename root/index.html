      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p align="right">
        Hi! I’m Gabriel, a second-year computer science student at the University of Toronto. I’m majoring in computer science, and taking minors and math and stats alongside. My area of interest spans multiple fields, but I am especially interested in quantitative finance, machine learning, and full-stack software development. I thrive in collaborative environments, and believe teamwork drives innovation and creativity.

    <div class="about-iq">
        <p>IQ-Gen is a free online tool that aims to help young professionals prepare for behavioral interviews by utilizing a large language model to generate personalized interview questions. It was created my myself and a small group of peers for UTMIST’s LLM Engineering program, and was meant to tackle a real-world problem that we ourselves had faced. </p>

        <span><p align="right">Users are able answer questions by speaking directly to their computer and will receive responses and follow-up questions from a virtual interviewer. The program will then analyze the response, and provide feedback on the user's word choice and the overall quality of the user’s response.
          Most recently, IQ-GEN has been featured as an interactive booth at UTMIST’s Eigen AI conference, presented alongside a curated selection of student ML projects.

        <p align="right">The Campbellford Memorial Hospital (CMH) finance department handles the finances from the entirety of the hospital, from ER costs to pharmacy billings. As an intern within the department, I was able to work on the accounts payable desk, managing the organization and posting of a variety of different types of invoices. Besides learning many general finance and accounting principles, I was able to develop a greater appreciation for the rigor and detail with which financial transactions and records must be handled.</p>
